Learn why this new open standard makes agents like goose truly editor-agnostic, improving AI-human collaboration and restoring developer flow state. ACP works alongside protocols like MCP to create an open AI tooling ecosystem.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Choose Your IDE" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/choose-your-ide-c308664c1783e1651d9a4f4d6ff7d731.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I code best when I sit criss-cross applesauce on my bed or couch with my laptop in my lap, a snack nearby, and no extra screens competing for my attention. Sometimes I keep the editor and browser side by side; other times, I make them full screen and switch between applications. I don't like using multiple monitors, and my developer environment is embarrassingly barebones.</p>
<p>The described setup allows me to fall into a deep flow state, which is essential for staying productive as a software engineer. It gives me the focus to dig beneath the surface of a problem, trace its root cause, and think about how every fix or improvement affects both users and the system as a whole. While quick bursts of multitasking may work well for other fields, real productivity in engineering often comes from long stretches of uninterrupted thought.</p>
<p>Recently, my workflow changed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-three-app-problem">The Three-App Problem<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/24/intro-to-agent-client-protocol-acp#the-three-app-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Three-App Problem" title="Direct link to The Three-App Problem" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Now that I use an AI agent regularly, I need to juggle three applications: my editor, my AI agent, and my browser to see what gets rendered. This creates several challenges that disrupt my flow:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Reduced screen real estate.</strong> When I try to keep all three windows visible at once in a split-screen layout, each window becomes cramped. My editor shrinks to a narrow column, making it hard to read code. The AI agent window can't display full responses without scrolling. And my browser preview gets squeezed into a tiny viewport that doesn't reflect how users will actually see the app.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>The temptation to go agent-only.</strong> To avoid the cramped feeling, I sometimes keep only the AI agent window open full-screen, trusting whatever it generates without switching to my editor to review the actual code changes or examine diffs. While this works fine for experimental projects, production systems require human oversight and careful code review.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Awkward context switching.</strong> My other approach is to keep the AI agent full-screen but actually do the responsible thing and review its work. I'll read the agent's suggestion, switch windows to my editor to see the change, switch to my browser to check what rendered, then switch back to the agent to continue refining the code through iterative prompts (what Patrick Erichsen from <a href="https://continue.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Continue</a> calls <a href="https://patrickerichsen.com/chiseling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">chiseling</a>). This constant window-switching breaks my concentration and creates opportunities for distraction (hello, Twitter/X).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="common-workarounds">Common Workarounds<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/24/intro-to-agent-client-protocol-acp#common-workarounds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Common Workarounds" title="Direct link to Common Workarounds" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Many developers have tried to solve this integration challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>IDE-integrated agents</strong> like Cursor have an AI agent baked into the code editor. However, this creates vendor lock-in where you must use their specific agent with their specific editor. If I preferred VS Code as an editor and Claude Code as my agent, I'd be out of luck. I can't mix and match the tools I want.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>CLI agents in the terminal</strong> work for some people. They run the agent directly in their editor's terminal pane. <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/">goose</a> has a CLI I could use this way, but I prefer the desktop app's interface for readability and navigating responses. The tradeoff is the constant window-switching I was trying to avoid.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>IDE extensions and plugins</strong> seem like an obvious solution, but maintaining these integrations is incredibly difficult. In the past year, multiple maintainers built VS Code extensions and even an IntelliJ plugin for goose, but our twice-weekly releases quickly made them outdated. Maintaining these extensions became a constant game of catch-up that our community couldn't win. Extensions have to mirror goose's functionality to work properly, so every change to goose requires updating the extensions. Maintainers couldn't keep pace, and building specific integrations for every editor simply doesn't scale when agents evolve at such a fast pace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="introducing-agent-client-protocol">Introducing Agent Client Protocol<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/24/intro-to-agent-client-protocol-acp#introducing-agent-client-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing Agent Client Protocol" title="Direct link to Introducing Agent Client Protocol" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Zed Industries, the creators of the Zed code editor, developed a solution called <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a> that resolves these integration challenges. ACP allows you to bring any AI agent into any supporting editor without vendor lock-in. More importantly, it solves the maintenance problem because the AI agent and editor communicate directly through a standardized protocol.</p>
<p>This standardization is achieved by defining a common language via JSON-RPC. Instead of every editor and agent building private, complex handshakes, ACP uses a simple, predictable sequence of structured messages to manage the agent-editor session:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>session/initialize:</strong> Your AI agent tells the editor what capabilities it supports (audio, text prompts, etc.)</li>
<li class=""><strong>session/new:</strong> When you start a new session, the agent and editor establish communication</li>
<li class=""><strong>session/prompt:</strong> When you send a prompt, the agent receives and processes it</li>
<li class=""><strong>session/update:</strong> The agent sends responses back to the editor</li>
<li class=""><strong>session/cancel:</strong> When you cancel a session, the agent stops processing</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, editors that support ACP include Zed, Neovim, and Marimo. Supported agents include Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini, StackPack, and of course, goose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="restoring-developer-flow">Restoring Developer Flow<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/24/intro-to-agent-client-protocol-acp#restoring-developer-flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Restoring Developer Flow" title="Direct link to Restoring Developer Flow" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>For developers like me who have specific ways of achieving flow state, this means we can add AI assistance without completely restructuring our work environment. I can keep my criss-cross applesauce position, my split-screen setup, and my focused workflow while having goose integrated directly into my editor.</p>
<p>Beyond personal workflow preferences, ACP lowers the barrier to innovation by allowing AI agents and editors to evolve independently while speaking a shared language. And it's part of a broader movement toward open standards in AI tooling.</p>
<p>You might have heard of <a href="http://modelcontextprotocol.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MCP</a>, which standardizes how AI agents connect to data sources and tools. ACP and MCP complement each other perfectly: MCP handles the <em>what</em> (what data and tools can agents access), while ACP handles the <em>where</em> (where the agent lives in your workflow). Together, they create an ecosystem where developers can mix and match the best tools without vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>The goose team continues working to keep goose cutting-edge in the AI agent space, and we're excited about a future where open protocols let developers work however they work best.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Building intent-based AI experiences with MCP-UI.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Designing AI For Users" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/design-ai-de5d0af69d8d21111dd271624ac7cab3.png" width="2240" height="1260" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>My mom was doing her usual Sunday ritual she had her pen, paper, calculator, and a pile of receipts. I’ve tried to get her to use every budgeting app out there, but she’s old school and always says the same thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They’re all too complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last month, halfway through crunching numbers, she sighed and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I just wish I could see where my money’s going.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I opened <a href="http://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><strong>goose</strong></a>, added her notes, and turned on <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/autovisualiser-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><strong>Auto Visualiser</strong></a>. In seconds, her budget became this colorful, interactive chart. She hovered over each slice, analyzing where her money was going.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying this is some groundbreaking use case. There are plenty of apps that do this. What stood out to me was how simple it felt. My mom didn’t need to learn anything new or adapt to someone else’s design. The visualization just appeared, and she got it immediately.</p>
<p>It wasn’t about the tech working. It was about AI finally showing up in a way that made sense to her.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="when-ai-starts-showing-not-just-talking"><strong>When AI Starts Showing, Not Just Talking</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/14/designing-ai-for-humans#when-ai-starts-showing-not-just-talking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to when-ai-starts-showing-not-just-talking" title="Direct link to when-ai-starts-showing-not-just-talking" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>We’ve made huge progress with agentic AI. Agents can plan, reason, and act, but they often still communicate like terminals with walls of text, and no real interaction. That’s where <a href="https://mcpui.dev/guide/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><strong>MCP-UI</strong></a> changes everything.</p>
<p>MCP-UI gives agents a visual language <em>and</em> a way for users to interact directly within the chat window. Before this, conversations with AI consisted of a chain of prompts and responses. Now, users can actually engage with their agent through the interface itself. A button can launch a new prompt without the user typing anything. A dropdown can run a tool call in the background. A link can open a page or resource for them instantly. Even notifications can be exchanged between this embedded UI and the host application to keep everything in sync.</p>
<p>This is what turns an AI chat into an interface layer. Instead of describing what it can do, the agent can present real, clickable options and respond to them in real time. That makes AI conversations feel fluid and interactive.</p>
<p>Instead of saying, ‘Here’s your data,’ your agent can show it, let you act on it, and react to what you choose.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-this-matters-for-builders"><strong>Why This Matters for Builders</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/14/designing-ai-for-humans#why-this-matters-for-builders" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-this-matters-for-builders" title="Direct link to why-this-matters-for-builders" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>As developers, we often design for the model first, thinking about prompt structure or JSON formatting. But the next big step for agents is how well they can anticipate what the user wants to do and needs to see.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing this shift across the industry. Google’s new AI Mode is transforming search into an intent-driven experience. Instead of sending users to links, it now shows tickets, seat maps, and purchase buttons directly in the results. The web is becoming dynamic, adapting to what users are trying to do.</p>
<p>MCP-UI brings that same evolution into the agent world. It extends the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Model Context Protocol</a> so your MCP server can return more than just data. It can render interactive components right inside your agent's chat. Whether it’s a chart, button, table, or form, the agent can display live, usable views of your service instead of describing them in text.</p>
<p>goose’s built-in Auto Visualiser is one example of this in action, automatically turning structured output into interactive visuals using MCP-UI behind the scenes.</p>
<p>But the potential goes much further. When developers build their own MCP servers, they get full control over <em>how</em>  their data appears. They can design interfaces that reflect their brand or product style, ensuring users interacting with their API through an AI agent still get a familiar experience. Imagine a Shopify MCP server returning product listings that look like their storefront, or a Notion MCP server displaying content in its block layout inside the chat.</p>
<p>Both point to the same future: one where AI doesn’t just reply with text, but responds with the right interface for the moment. Instead of fixed screens, we get dynamic, intent-based experiences that adapt to what the user needs in real time.</p>
<p>That’s what Agentic UX is really about: building AI that responds to what the user intends to do.</p>
<p>If you’re building your own MCP server, start by thinking about the experience you want your users to have. Then experiment with MCP-UI and design the flow you’d expect if you were the one using it.

<p>I have a feeling that next month, when my mom sits down to balance her bills, she’s going to ask me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You brought that goose thing again?”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how goose can study your past sessions and turn your favorite workflows into reusable automation templates.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Recipe Cookbook Generator" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/recipe-cookbook-generator-ba6ce396585e1fc591e339720ee80a30.png" width="1960" height="1029" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You've been using goose for weeks, maybe months. You have dozens of successful <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/sessions/">sessions</a> where you asked for help with blog posts, code reviews, documentation, or data analysis. Each time you think "Didn't I already do this?" but never get around to checking. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I myself had over a hundred goose sessions and as many megabytes of conversation data. I was sitting on a goldmine of potential automation. A coworker suggested something brilliant: "What if goose could analyze your sessions and build recipes automatically?" Wait, wait, wait!! Create a personalized cookbook based on my own session history? Yes, please! Let's build a "cookbook generator" recipe!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-problem-with-manual-recipe-creation">The Problem with Manual Recipe Creation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/08/recipe-cookbook-generator#the-problem-with-manual-recipe-creation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem with Manual Recipe Creation" title="Direct link to The Problem with Manual Recipe Creation" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Creating recipes manually is time-consuming, especially if you're looking through dozens or hundreds of previous sessions like I was, to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Figure out which sessions were successful or not</li>
<li class="">Extract the core workflow from lengthy conversations</li>
<li class="">Identify similar but not identical workflows and figure out what should be parameterized</li>
<li class="">Write proper YAML syntax with templating, maybe build subrecipes?</li>
<li class="">Test and refine the recipe structure</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn't this the goal of having an AI agent in the first place? To save time and effort?</p>
<p>Let's boost our productivity by implementing some automation. We're gonna get goose to write a recipe that creates OTHER recipes!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-is-the-cookbook-generator-recipe">What is the Cookbook Generator Recipe?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/08/recipe-cookbook-generator#what-is-the-cookbook-generator-recipe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the Cookbook Generator Recipe?" title="Direct link to What is the Cookbook Generator Recipe?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The "cookbook generator" I'm describing here is a way to get goose to look at your previous sessions, analyze them for commonalities, and automatically create new recipes from common patterns. It's automation that creates automation -- meta-programming at its finest.</p>
<p>I'm going to share my own cookbook generator at the end.</p>
<p>Here's what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Scans your session history</strong> -- Finds and reads all your goose session files</li>
<li class=""><strong>Identifies successful workflows</strong> -- Filters out incomplete or failed sessions</li>
<li class=""><strong>Detects patterns</strong> -- Groups similar requests and workflows together</li>
<li class=""><strong>Generates parameterized recipes</strong> -- Creates reusable YAML files with proper templating</li>
<li class=""><strong>Handles sensitive data</strong> -- Asks how to deal with file paths, API keys, and personal information</li>
<li class=""><strong>Tracks progress</strong> -- Remembers when it last ran to only process new sessions</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result is a personalized cookbook of recipes tailored to your own specific workflows.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_1GALH2ER0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">I demonstrated on a livestream</a> my whole process of creating this generator using "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjXmT0W4f2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">vibe prompting</a>" -- having an extended conversation with goose to refine the idea and answer potential questions upfront. This approach uses fewer tokens than iterative coding, resulting in higher success rates.</p>
<iframe class="aspect-ratio" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_1GALH2ER0" title="Vibe Code with goose: Automate my workflow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
<p>During my own conversation with goose, goose asked smart questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Pattern recognition</strong>: How should we identify common workflows vs one-off tasks?</li>
<li class=""><strong>Granularity</strong>: Should we create specific recipes or more general patterns?</li>
<li class=""><strong>Sensitive information</strong>: How should we handle file paths, API keys, and personal data?</li>
<li class=""><strong>Reusability</strong>: What parameters should be auto-detected vs user-specified?</li>
<li class=""><strong>Which sessions to consider</strong>: I had an extended project that I didn't want included -- it was dozens of sessions about a single project, no point making a recipe for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>By answering these questions upfront, we created a comprehensive specification before writing any code.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="key-features-of-the-generator">Key Features of the Generator<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/10/08/recipe-cookbook-generator#key-features-of-the-generator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features of the Generator" title="Direct link to Key Features of the Generator" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p>The generator reads through your session files (typically stored in <code>~/.local/share/goose/sessions/</code> but this may vary on your platform, and may change in future goose releases) and analyzes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Overall outcome success</li>
<li class="">User request patterns</li>
<li class="">Tool usage sequences</li>
<li class="">Common parameter types it could extract</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one was really important for me. I ask goose all the time to help me build an outline for blog posts like this, or video scripts for our <a href="https://youtube.com/@goose-oss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">YouTube channel</a>, or tutorial pages. They all follow a similar pattern, around a topic or subject, but the output format may vary.</p>

<p>Not every session should become a recipe. The generator should skip sessions that seem incomplete or abandoned, or compared with other sessions to determine if this was a one-off task. Still, what might appear to be a one-off task might actually be the start of something I want to repeat.</p>
<p>Having goose prompt me for whether I know ahead of time if there are any sessions I want to exclude was helpful -- I have several REALLY large, long sessions about the <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog/">community cookbook security scanner</a> I built, but I didn't want to build a recipe out of all of that.</p>
<p>Instead, I wanted goose to focus on workflows that appear multiple times, and ask me to confirm any cases that it was unsure about.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="3-parameterization-logic">3.

<p>The tool should automatically identify good candidates for parameters. I had ideas around the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Was I accessing file paths and directory structures regularly?</li>
<li class="">Were there specific document types I was accessing, or trying to create? (blog posts, videos, documentation)</li>
<li class="">Was I regularly accessing the same kinds of URLs and external resources</li>
<li class="">Were there any common project names or topics, like MCP?</li>

I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/block/goose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">goose repository</a> and told goose to examine its own source code to learn how to successfully create recipes, and be sure to use proper YAML syntax.</p></div></div>
<p>From that, I had goose think about the following ideas as it considered how to make my recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Parameter validation and defaults</li>
<li class="">Conditional logic for different scenarios</li>
<li class="">Loop constructs for repetitive tasks</li>
<li class="">Subrecipe integration where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>Building the cookbook generator took a little over an hour of "vibe prompting" and refining the idea, and then goose gave me a recipe. I always verify my AI-generated work, and then spent about 15 minutes more after the livestream refining some ideas and adding more guardrails to the recipe.</p>
<p>The recipes it generated for me were exactly as I had predicted:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Outline Generator</strong>: parameterized for what kind of content I was making: a blog post, a video (and what kind), or tutorial documentation</li>
<li class=""><strong>Open Source Code Generator</strong>: I often make little code samples to work alongside my blog posts or need code to demonstrate a concept in a video, but might change up the programming language. Nah, who am I kidding, it's always gonna be Python for me.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Research Assistant</strong>: I frequently ask for help gathering information on a topic, but the scope and depth varies. This recipe lets me specify how deep to go and what kinds of sources to prioritize.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Image Generation</strong>: I need thumbnail ideas for videos and blog posts, but the style and focus can vary widely. This recipe lets me specify the theme and mood.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Social Media Posts</strong>: I struggle a lot with coming up with catchy social media posts, so I want to give goose the kind of content (blog, video, etc), point it at the content (in the case of video, I give it my narration script), and have it generate many different options that I can choose from later.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recipes were about 90% workable, and I went through and refined some of those a bit further.</p>

<p>By running the outline generator recipe (three times), the image generator recipe, and social media recipe, goose took care of the following work:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">the outline for this blog post, so I could write the content faster</li>
<li class="">the "conveyor belt" image at the top of this post (via Gemini)</li>
<li class="">the social media posts you saw that brought you here</li>
<li class="">the video script for the short video in the social media posts</li>
<li class="">the script outline for a longer video going on our <a href="https://youtube.com/@goose-oss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">YouTube channel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, yeah. They work!</p>

<p>This approach represents a new level of AI-assisted productivity. Instead of manually identifying automation opportunities, the AI identifies them for you. It's like having a productivity consultant that never sleeps, that can analyze your work patterns on demand, and suggest ways of automating things.</p>

<p>The cookbook generator also handles the tedious parts of recipe creation:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Proper YAML syntax and structure</li>
<li class="">Parameter type definitions and validation</li>
<li class="">Template logic and conditional statements</li>
<li class="">Extension requirements and dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>The cookbook generator tracks when it last ran according to the output folder where you tell it to build recipes, so subsequent executions only analyze new sessions. This makes regular updates efficient and practical.</p>

Roadmap?" title="Direct link to Future Enhancements? Roadmap?" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Could we expand the idea from here? Absolutely!</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Smart categorization</strong> -- Automatically organize recipes by domain (content, code, data)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Quality scoring</strong> -- Rank recipes by potential time savings and reuse frequency</li>
<li class=""><strong>Dependency detection</strong> -- Identify better places for recipes to use sub-recipes -- maybe I want to do a blog post AND a video AND social media posts all from the same recipe</li>
<li class=""><strong>Performance optimization</strong> -- Incremental analysis and caching for large session histories</li>
</ul>
<p>The last thing I'd want to improve would be to have goose re-analyze the recipes it made with newer sessions to refine existing recipes, instead of creating new recipes each time it runs.</p>

<p>The recipe cookbook generator is just the beginning. As AI agents become more sophisticated, we'll see more tools that create tools, automation that builds automation, and meta-programming approaches that amplify human productivity.</p>
<p>The key insight is that AI agents shouldn't just execute tasks -- they should learn from those executions and help us build better systems. This generator turns your goose usage history into a productivity asset, creating a personalized automation toolkit from your actual work patterns.</p>
<p>Start building your own cookbook generator, and stop doing the same work twice. Your future self will thank you for the automation you create today.</p>

<p>Here's the cookbook generator that goose helped me create, plus my own notes. You could try using it as-is, but I think a better approach would be to try vibe prompting with goose yourself to go analyze your own session history to see what kind of automation you want to set up for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subagents vs Subrecipes" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/subrecipes-vs-subagents-19bca16b86a951e4618be8ab6ce90fb2.png" width="1960" height="1029" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When you're working on complex projects with goose, you'll often need to break work into multiple tasks and run them with AI agents. Goose gives you two powerful ways to do this: <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/subagents/">subagents</a> and <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/subrecipes-in-parallel/">subrecipes</a>. Both can run multiple AI instances in parallel, but they work  differently. Picking which one to use can be confusing, so we're going to guide you to a decision.</p>
<p>I've been using both approaches, and the choice between them depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Let me break down when to use each method and show you real examples.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-core-difference-to-re-use-or-not-re-use">The Core Difference: To Re-Use or Not Re-Use<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#the-core-difference-to-re-use-or-not-re-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Core Difference: To Re-Use or Not Re-Use" title="Direct link to The Core Difference: To Re-Use or Not Re-Use" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Subagents are temporary AI instances that you create with natural language in your prompt and tend to be one-off tasks and then disappear.</p>
<p>Subrecipes are pre-written files full of instructions that define reusable workflows you can run repeatedly with customized parameters.</p>
<p>The TL;DR: subagents are for quick, one-off delegation. Subrecipes are for structured, repeatable processes.</p>
<p>Also, both are still in 'experimental' status, so there's always a possibility their features and capabilities will change over time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="subagents-quick-and-flexible">Subagents: Quick and Flexible<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#subagents-quick-and-flexible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Subagents: Quick and Flexible" title="Direct link to Subagents: Quick and Flexible" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Subagents excel when you're in a goose session and just want task delegation without setup overhead. Here's how simple they are to use:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Build a simple task management web app doing these 3 tasks in parallel:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- one task writes the backend API code (Node.js/Express with basic CRUD operations for tasks)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- one task writes comprehensive tests for the API endpoints</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">- one task creates user documentation explaining how to use the API</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Each task should work independently and complete their part simultaneously.</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Goose automatically spawns three independent AI instances, and each works on a different component. You get real-time progress tracking and they all work in parallel from that prompt. You're off and running: no setup, no configuration files, just natural language instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Quick setup with natural language</strong> -- No recipe files to write. Just describe what you want in your prompt.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Process isolation</strong> -- Failures don't affect your main workflow. Each subagent runs independently.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Context preservation</strong> -- Keeps your main chat clean by offloading detailed work to separate instances.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Flexible execution</strong> -- Easy to specify parallel or sequential execution in your prompt.</li>
<li class=""><strong>External integration</strong> -- Can use external AI agents like Codex or Claude Code.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Real-time progress</strong> -- Live monitoring dashboard shows task completion status.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Limited reusability</strong> -- Each subagent is created from scratch. No saved configuration.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Common LLM</strong> -- All subagents share the same LLM model as the parent session.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Tool restrictions</strong> -- Subagents can't manage extensions, they can only use what the main session already had access to before the subagents were launched.</li>
<li class=""><strong>No persistence</strong> -- Configuration isn't saved for future use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="subrecipes-structured-and-reusable">Subrecipes: Structured and Reusable<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#subrecipes-structured-and-reusable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Subrecipes: Structured and Reusable" title="Direct link to Subrecipes: Structured and Reusable" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Subrecipes solve the reusability problem. While main "parent" recipes can be in YAML or JSON, subrecipes can only be written in YAML format. These files define structured workflows with parameters, validation, extensions to use, and even allow you to pick a different provider/model to use for the work.</p>

<ul>
<li class=""><strong>High reusability</strong> -- Recipe files can be shared and version controlled across projects.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Structured parameters</strong> -- Type-safe parameter handling with validation and documentation.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Template support</strong> -- Dynamic parameter injection using template syntax.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Full tool access</strong> -- Subrecipes can use any extensions and tools available to goose.</li>
<li class=""><strong>LLM customization</strong> -- Each subrecipe can specify its own LLM model to use.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Conditional logic</strong> -- Smart parameter passing based on conversation context.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Workflow orchestration</strong> -- Complex multi-step processes with dependencies and execution order control.</li>

<p><strong>Use subagents when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">You need quick, one-off task delegation</li>
<li class="">Tasks can be completed independently and don't need to be repeated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use subrecipes when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Building reusable workflows you can share with your team</li>
<li class="">Need structured parameter handling</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="common-benefits-and-limitations-of-both-approaches">Common Benefits and Limitations of Both Approaches<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#common-benefits-and-limitations-of-both-approaches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Common Benefits and Limitations of Both Approaches" title="Direct link to Common Benefits and Limitations of Both Approaches" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Both of these features share some limitations. We've already mentioned the experimental and evolving nature, but there are a few more important ones to note:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p>Subrecipes and subagents run their tasks in isolation and do not share state with one another. This isolation helps prevent conflicts and keeps tasks self-contained. If you do need to share information between the processes, you will have to be very explicit about this in your prompts and instructions.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Neither can spawn additional similar workers: subagents can't create more subagents, and subrecipes can't call other subrecipes. This prevents runaway processes but limits deep nesting.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Whether you're using subagents or subrecipes, you can only run up to 10 concurrent parallel workers total. This is not user-configurable, but this limit keeps resource usage manageable; this may limit very large-scale parallelism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="getting-started">Getting Started<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#getting-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started" title="Direct link to Getting Started" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>My recommendation: start with subagents to experiment and understand your workflow needs. They're easier to get started with because you don't need to write configuration files first.</p>
<p>Once you identify patterns you want to repeat, you can convert that subagent workflow session into a recipe and subrecipe structure. This gives you the best progression from experimentation to production.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-choice-is-yours">The Choice is Yours<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#the-choice-is-yours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Choice is Yours" title="Direct link to The Choice is Yours" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The choice depends on your specific needs and workflow requirements. Quick tasks that won't be repeated favor subagents. Complex workflows with multiple steps or customization favor subrecipes.</p>
<p>Your workflow requirements should drive the decision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="goose Subrecipes" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-subrecipes-8a009154ceca95aeb34bf22fcc45dcca.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Remember when you first learned to cook? You probably started with simple recipes like scrambled eggs or toast. But eventually you wanted to make something more complex, like a full dinner with multiple dishes. That's how subrecipes work in goose: each recipe can run stand-alone for a dedicated task, and a main recipe can orchestrate how they run.</p>
<p>Let's explore <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/subrecipes-in-parallel">goose subrecipes</a> together! You're about to learn know how to orchestrate multiple AI models, coordinate tasks, and build workflows that will turn you into a "head chef" user with goose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-subrecipes-matter">Why Subrecipes Matter<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#why-subrecipes-matter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Subrecipes Matter" title="Direct link to Why Subrecipes Matter" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Think of subrecipes like having a team of specialized chefs in your kitchen. One chef is amazing at making desserts, another excels at grilling, and a third is the salad master. Instead of having one person try to do everything, you let each specialist focus on what they do best.</p>
<p>That's exactly what subrecipes do for your goose workflows. You can have one recipe that's optimized for creative tasks like image generation, another that's perfect for technical documentation, and a third that excels at writing code. Then you orchestrate them all from a main recipe.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a-real-world-example-project-setup-automation">A Real-World Example: Project Setup Automation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#a-real-world-example-project-setup-automation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Real-World Example: Project Setup Automation" title="Direct link to A Real-World Example: Project Setup Automation" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I built a project setup system that creates a complete project with documentation, logo generator, and an initial codebase. Instead of one massive recipe trying to do everything, I broke it into specialized pieces.</p>
<p>Here's the parent recipe that orchestrates everything:</p>

<p>Notice how each subrecipe gets only the parameters it needs, and we can control the execution order in our prompt.</p>
<p>By default, subrecipes run in <em>parallel</em>. This is like having multiple chefs working simultaneously in different parts of the kitchen. The image generation and code writing happen at the same time, cutting your total execution time.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need things to happen in order. The best approach here is to list the specific order you want in the recipe instructions. In this example, I want the image and code generation to happen in parallel (because they don't depend on each other), and only run the README generation when the other two steps are both successful so it can reference the generated files.</p>

<p>Each subrecipe is optimized for its specific job.</p>

<p>For the image generation, we could use an image generator MCP system in a smaller recipe. For this example, though, I'm going to have this recipe write a specific script to call OpenAI's DALL-E API directly. This gives me more control over the image generation process and avoids external resources.</p>

<p>Debugging subrecipes is straightforward if you follow a few best practices:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="1-make-sure-each-recipe-runs-independently">1. Make Sure Each Recipe Runs Independently<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#1-make-sure-each-recipe-runs-independently" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Make Sure Each Recipe Runs Independently" title="Direct link to 1. Make Sure Each Recipe Runs Independently" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is crucial. Each subrecipe should work perfectly on its own. Test them individually before combining them. If a subrecipe fails when run alone, it will definitely fail as part of a larger workflow.</p>

Use recipe_dir for Relative Paths" title="Direct link to 2. Use recipe_dir for Relative Paths" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Always use <code>{{ recipe_dir }}</code> for file paths within your recipes. This makes your recipes portable and prevents path issues when someone runs them from a different directory.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="3-parameter-validation-is-your-friend">3. Parameter Validation is Your Friend<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#3-parameter-validation-is-your-friend" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Parameter Validation is Your Friend" title="Direct link to 3. Parameter Validation is Your Friend" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Include clear parameter descriptions and mark required parameters. This prevents confusing errors when someone forgets to pass a needed value.</p>

<p>Start simple. Pick a complex task you do regularly and break it into 2-3 smaller pieces. Create individual recipes for each piece, test them separately, then build a parent recipe to orchestrate them.</p>
<p>Some ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Content Creation Pipeline</strong>: Research, writing, editing, and formatting</li>
<li class=""><strong>Development Workflow</strong>: Code generation, testing, documentation, deployment</li>
<li class=""><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization</li>
<li class=""><strong>Project Setup</strong>: Structure creation, configuration, initial files, documentation</li>

<p>Subrecipes represent something bigger than just a goose feature. They're a glimpse into how we'll work with AI in the future -- not as monolithic systems trying to do everything, but as specialized agents working together toward common goals.</p>
<p>Each recipe becomes a reusable component that you can mix and match. Build a library of specialized recipes, then combine them in different ways for different projects. It's like having a toolkit of AI specialists ready to tackle any challenge.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How I made existing MCP servers MCP-UI compatible with just a few lines of code]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcp-ui-0a7ec9ab9d9b8b0f84e1372e956cfbde.png" width="2240" height="1260" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><a href="https://mcpui.dev/guide/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MCP-UI</a> is in its infancy, and there's something addictive about being this early to the party. We're at this fascinating point where both the spec and client implementations are actively developing, and I find it thrilling to build alongside that evolution.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how far I could push it. So I grabbed two open source MCP servers, <a href="https://github.com/felores/cloudinary-mcp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Cloudinary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Filesystem</a>, and gave them a UI. Instead of boring text, I now get rich, interactive interfaces right inside goose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-i-wanted-this">Why I Wanted This<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/08/turn-any-mcp-server-mcp-ui-compatible#why-i-wanted-this" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I Wanted This" title="Direct link to Why I Wanted This" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Raw JSON and text is fine, it gets the job done but let's be real I'd rather interact with something pretty. Give me a cool UI over back and forth prompts.</p>
<p>Take Cloudinary for example. By default, uploads return a block of text, basically a JSON dump of URLs, metadata, and public IDs. Useful, sure, but not exactly easy to glance at.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Image and video previews</li>
<li class="">One‑click buttons to copy or view links</li>
<li class="">Transformation examples</li>
</ul>
<p>With MCP-UI, it’s not just text responses anymore. Now responses can be little apps you can actually click around in within your agent's chat interface.</p>

<p>For my Cloudinary server update, I used <code>Direct HTML → iframe</code>. I wrote a function that returns an HTML string that includes upload previews and action buttons.</p>
<p>MCP-UI takes that HTML and renders it inside an iframe using <code>srcdoc</code>.<br>
<!-- -->It’s simple, totally self-contained, fast to iterate, and I get full control over how it looks.</p>
<p>💡 However, other modes exist:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>External URL</strong> – iframe a hosted page:<br>
<code>content: { type: "externalUrl", iframeUrl }</code></p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Remote DOM</strong> – send a script that builds UI directly in the host’s DOM:<br>
<code>content: { type: "remoteDom", script, framework }</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But for my use case, <strong>Direct HTML was the perfect fit.</strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="4-return-both"><strong>4. Return both</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/08/turn-any-mcp-server-mcp-ui-compatible#4-return-both" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4-return-both" title="Direct link to 4-return-both" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In your tool handler, I recommend returning both the original response and the <code>createUIResource</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it. Regardless the server the main steps remain the same.</p>

<p>I’ve now made two MCP servers UI-compatible, before MCP-UI is even fully rolled out. That's crazy to me.</p>
<p>And if you zoom out, you’ll see other companies pushing here too. goose and Postman already support rendering and a couple of UI actions. In goose right now, a button can fire off a new prompt or open an external link. It’s not the full vision yet, but it’s already enough to start building experiences that feel more like mini-apps than static responses.</p>
<p>That’s what excites me, we’re not waiting around. We’re experimenting in the open, and shaping what the future will feel like.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How an engineering team is trialling autonomous AI-powered technical debt cleanup]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-janitor-129889884d9265d001fe12cbfde03d57.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Over the years, Block's iOS engineers have felt the pain of technical debt accumulating. Feature flags are a specific example of this. Even when successfully rolled out, they tend to linger in the codebase, each one a small weight slowing down development.</p>
<p>In the early stages of 2025, with a renewed focus on developer acceleration, the Foundation iOS team decided to organize 'Feature Flag Removal Month' - an opportunity for teams in the large iOS monorepo to come together and delete <em>possibly hundreds of thousands of lines of dead code</em>.</p>
<p>With the serendipitous launch of Goose recipes around the same time, the team wondered could a dedicated recipe aid this effort? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmakbarlow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Gemma Barlow</a>, a newer iOS engineer on the team, wanted to find out.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="phase-1-making-knowledge-ai-accessible">Phase 1: Making Knowledge AI-Accessible<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#phase-1-making-knowledge-ai-accessible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 1: Making Knowledge AI-Accessible" title="Direct link to Phase 1: Making Knowledge AI-Accessible" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Gemma's first move was to utilize an existing system of <code>.mdc</code>, <code>.goosehints</code> and other symlinked context documents to capture how to safely remove feature flags from the repository.</p>
<p>She added documentation that allows AI agents to glean enough context to perform their removal work accurately.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="phase-2-validation-across-generations">Phase 2: Validation Across Generations<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#phase-2-validation-across-generations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 2: Validation Across Generations" title="Direct link to Phase 2: Validation Across Generations" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Given AI documentation is designed to work with a variety of tools in use at Block, further iteration and validation was needed. Several weeks of tests and trials later, it was confirmed the approach was accurate enough to be useful <em>and</em> it could handle the three different generations of feature flag implementations that had accumulated:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">super legacy flags the team used way back yonder</li>
<li class="">legacy flags that were newer but are now old</li>
<li class="">current implementation of feature flags</li>
</ul>
<p>This documentation alone would help teams clean up faster. But now, AI could also understand and safely navigate the complexity of real world legacy systems in most scenarios, a win for developer velocity! 🎉</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="phase-3-building-an-ai-team-member">Phase 3: Building an AI Team Member<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#phase-3-building-an-ai-team-member" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 3: Building an AI Team Member" title="Direct link to Phase 3: Building an AI Team Member" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This was great progress. Gemma could have stopped here.</p>
<p>But instead, she utilized Goose recipes to create <strong>Goose Janitor</strong>.</p>
<p>Goose Janitor acts as new AI team member whose responsibility is to tidy up the code after we're done experimenting. It was heavily inspired by existing <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/recipes/detail/?id=clean-up-feature-flag">Goose recipes</a> and internal discussions and experimentation occurring elsewhere in Block. Here's how it is run:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">goose run \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">--recipe .goose/recipes/goose-janitor-flag-removal.yaml \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">--params feature_flag_key=log-observer-is-enabled \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">--params variant_to_remain=true \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">--params create_pr=false</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Runs completely autonomously (no human intervention needed)</li>
<li class="">Handles different flag implementations, ranging in complexity</li>
<li class="">Attempts refactoring for outdated code paths</li>
<li class="">Can automatically create draft pull requests, via the Github CLI</li>
<li class="">Integrates with <a href="https://github.com/block/xcode-index-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Xcode Index MCP</a> for deep iOS project understanding</li>
<li class="">Plans, implements, builds and tests locally to improve the accuracy of the flag removal result</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-bigger-picture-ai-first-development">The Bigger Picture: AI-First Development<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#the-bigger-picture-ai-first-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Bigger Picture: AI-First Development" title="Direct link to The Bigger Picture: AI-First Development" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Recipes like Goose Janitor represent a fundamental shift in how we think about AI in software development. They can be deployed to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Understand complex legacy codebases</li>
<li class="">Make safe refactoring decisions</li>
<li class="">Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows</li>
<li class="">Provide developer velocity improvements</li>
<li class="">Scale across large codebases</li>
</ul>
<p>Teams at Block are confident that Goose Janitor will be of assistance in production scale cleanup work.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of work AI should handle: tedious, repetitive, but requiring deep codebase knowledge. By automating portions of their work, developers can focus on what they do best, which is building new features and solving novel problems while AI keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-ai-first-mindset">The AI-First Mindset<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#the-ai-first-mindset" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The AI-First Mindset" title="Direct link to The AI-First Mindset" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This story illustrates what an AI-first approach to legacy codebases looks like in practice.</p>
<p>Start by making tribal knowledge AI-accessible. Test and validate that AI can actually handle the complexity with enough accuracy to prove useful. Even if manual intervention is required for complex cases, a first pass performed by AI can be a useful boost to productivity. Build automation that scales across teams and focus human energy on high value creative work.</p>

<p>The success of Goose Janitor opens up fascinating possibilities. What other forms of technical debt could benefit from this approach? What other "AI team members" could we build to handle routine but knowledge intensive work?</p>
<p>As we move toward an AI-first future, stories like Gemma's show us the path. Not just using AI tools, but thinking systematically about how to make our codebases and processes AI-ready.</p>
<p>The future of software development is mixed teams where AI agents are autonomous contributors, handling the maintenance work that keeps our systems healthy while humans focus on building the future.</p>

<p>Data visualization just got a major upgrade in Goose. With the new MCP-UI auto visualiser feature, you no longer need to manually request charts, graphs, or visual representations of your data. Goose now automatically detects when data would benefit from visualization and renders interactive visual components directly in your conversation.</p>

<p>Once turned on, a smorgasboard of visualisation tools are made available as tools which will be automatically invoked if and when it makes sense to, for example, show things as a radar diagram, or a "sankey" diagram:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="sankey" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/sankey-10b4c1db30fdcaec0b1c538211385e47.png" width="1377" height="845" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You can also explicitly ask for a visualisation, even specifying what style you want, and Goose will try to shape your data and then render it inline. This is powered by the <a href="https://mcpui.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MCP-UI</a> emerging standard, which lets the MCP server formulate a visualisation (in this case using libraries like d3.js) and render it inline.</p>
<p>The autovisualiser analyzes data patterns and automatically suggests the most appropriate visualization type. My favourite is the treemap which is a great way to see relative sizes of things in a way that pie charts can mislead. It is also interactive in that you can drill down.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="tree map" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/treemap-fe432c41535964ba410c31915cb526fe.png" width="794" height="511" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Of course, if you want you can resort to the "last refuge of the unimaginative" and graph the weather:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="weather" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/weather-a3fbaf6e35e2793b986b8dcc4804620b.png" width="1006" height="658" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Note this is an early feature, and functionality may change and vary a lot (as with MCP-UI). This is an early example of what is emerging as generative UI, although in this case the templates are pre-generated and the data is dynamically matched to the session and then displayed (from local resources).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/tetrate-header-9e2afbf5d1ce961d5f25547a7439c65f.png" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You shouldn’t need a credit card to vibe code with goose. While goose is completely free to use, the reality is that most performant LLMs aren't. You want to experience goose in action without breaking the bank or jumping through hoops. We've been thinking about how to make that first step easier for newcomers to goose.</p>
<p>That's why we're thrilled about our newest provider integration: <a href="https://router.tetrate.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Tetrate's Agent Router Service</a>. New goose users can get $10 in credits to use goose with any model on the Tetrate platform.</p>
<p>We've upgraded the onboarding flow. Tetrate Agent Router now appears as a <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation#set-llm-provider">recommended setup option</a> for new users. Selecting Tetrate takes you through OAuth account creation, then drops you back into goose with your $10 credits ready to go.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="fresh install" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/welcome-759e755b4c027705f64202aad2ae75b6.png" width="955" height="1072" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This integration gives goose users:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Instant access</strong> to models without manual setup</li>
<li class=""><strong>$10 in credits</strong> to start building without a paywall</li>
<li class=""><strong>A unified model layer</strong> powered by Tetrate</li>
<li class=""><strong>Stable routing</strong> built on <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Envoy</a>, an open source proxy for high-scale systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Tetrate's Agent Router Service provides unified access to a comprehensive collection of AI models including open source options to cutting-edge frontier models like GPT-5, Sonnet-4, and Grok-4.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="from-cloud-infrastructure-to-ai-model-routing">From Cloud Infrastructure to AI Model Routing<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/27/get-started-for-free-with-tetrate#from-cloud-infrastructure-to-ai-model-routing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From Cloud Infrastructure to AI Model Routing" title="Direct link to From Cloud Infrastructure to AI Model Routing" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Tetrate brings years of expertise in routing and infrastructure to the AI space. As major contributors to open source projects like Istio and Envoy, they understand how to build reliable, scalable routing systems. Now they're applying this same expertise to LLM traffic management.</p>
<p>LLM requests are inherently stateless, making them ideal for intelligent routing across multiple providers and models. This allows you to optimize for cost, speed, availability, or quality, or even use multiple models to cross-check results. Terminology in this space is still settling. goose refers to Tetrate as a “provider” for consistency, though under the hood it is a router service that connects to other providers. That layer abstracts away model selection, auth, and host config, keeping your setup clean.</p>

<p>Our goal is simple: make goose accessible to everyone, immediately. That means removing barriers to getting started. Tetrate's generous credit offering and seamless integration help us achieve exactly that.</p>
<p>It also reflects Tetrate's ongoing commitment to open source and making AI development more accessible to developers worldwide.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Building community trust by having AI analyze AI recipes for safety]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Goose Recipe Safety" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-security-scanner-7fbe93f4a738fed2002e656fe66e715f.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Remember when people shared recipes by passing handwritten cards between neighbors? You trusted Grandma's apple pie recipe because you knew Grandma. But what happens when strangers start sharing recipes online? You need someone to taste-test them first.</p>
<p>That's exactly the challenge we face with Goose recipes. We're building a community cookbook where you can try Goose recipes from other users with confidence that they're safe. But we needed a way to make sure every recipe was safe to run.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-headless-solution">The Headless Solution<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#the-headless-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Headless Solution" title="Direct link to The Headless Solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I asked Goose: "Can you build a system to analyze your own recipes?"</p>
<p>The beautiful irony wasn't lost on me. I'm essentially asking our AI to become its own watchdog.</p>
<p>I gave it a lot more direction: I wanted the scanner to run from GitHub Actions, and I wanted the scanning to be done within a Docker container so it could inspect the recipe in an isolated environment.</p>
<p>After several high-level iterations on the concept and how it should work, Goose had built a complete security analysis system. It containerized itself, set up GitHub Actions workflows, and started scanning recipe submissions automatically.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="better-prompting-for-better-results">Better Prompting for Better Results<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#better-prompting-for-better-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better Prompting for Better Results" title="Direct link to Better Prompting for Better Results" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>My first build was pretty over-engineered. I simplified later by just giving Goose a prompt of "you're a security expert," but the results of that didn't work as well without guiding it on what kinds of things it should be looking for. I had to step up my prompting game to include <em>some</em> amount of specifics, but still giving Goose the flexibility to learn and grow and to download any tools it thought it needed to get the job done within the Docker container.</p>
<p>In the end I crafted a series of recipes that were safe, some that were maybe a little risky, and some that would be outright dangerous, and telling Goose some of the necessary things we want to watch out for.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How It Works" title="Direct link to How It Works" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The process at a glance seems surprisingly simple but it's pretty complex -- picture the graceful goose swimming on the water but under the water the feet are thrashing around doing lots of work!</p>
<p>When someone submits a recipe via our GitHub issue template, it will start an automated scan. Goose spins up in an isolated Docker container, analyzes the recipe using its own security expertise plus some of our guidance, scores it for risk, and posts the results right back to the GitHub issue.</p>
<p>The whole process takes minutes instead of days, and the submitter gets immediate, transparent feedback about their recipe's safety. If something looks off, our team can review what's going on, and take appropriate action.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="goose-in-headless-mode">Goose in Headless Mode<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#goose-in-headless-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goose in Headless Mode" title="Direct link to Goose in Headless Mode" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We've covered headless mode in <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/headless-goose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@goose-oss/search?query=headless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">videos</a>, but here's a quick recap: headless mode allows Goose to run without a graphical user interface, making it faster and more efficient for automated tasks. It excels in server environments as long as we're being <em>really</em> clear about the instructions to follow, or a fallback if the instructions cannot be followed -- we don't want something half-finished or broken as a result if Goose gets stuck on what to do.</p>
<p>We launch the Docker container with something like this:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">docker run --rm \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    -e AIMODEL_API_KEY="$AIMODEL_API_KEY" \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    -v "$PWD/$RECIPE_FILE:/input/recipe.yaml:ro" \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    -v "$RECIPE_OUT:/output" \</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing we're passing into Docker is the API key for whichever AI model we're using. i'm just using a placeholder of "AIMDOEL_API_KEY" but you would change this to OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY etc depending on the LLM you want Goose to use in your container.</p>
<p>Next, we're passing in the user's recipe that we're getting from GitHub, and then we have our "output" for logs and analysis.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="looking-inside-the-container">Looking Inside the Container<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#looking-inside-the-container" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Inside the Container" title="Direct link to Looking Inside the Container" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Inside the container, we're installing Goose, and passing in a configuration file for which AI provider and model we want to use, plus a "base" recipe that tells Goose how to analyze the user's recipe. That recipe is also reinforcing a role of Goose being a security expert.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-learning-curve">The Learning Curve<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#the-learning-curve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Learning Curve" title="Direct link to The Learning Curve" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Just telling Goose "you're a security expert" wasn't enough. It took some back-and-forth to teach the difference between a recipe that downloads a helpful development tool, and something that downloads something sketchy to your home directory to look for sensitive data.</p>
<p>We had to fine-tune the balance between security and usability. Too strict, and legitimate recipes get flagged. Too lenient, and dangerous ones slip through. Getting that balance right required showing Goose lots of examples of both safe and risky patterns. We pass those into the Docker container as well, and our "base" recipe tells Goose to use those as inspiration.</p>
<p>Then we go into "headless" mode:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">goose run --recipe base_recipe.yaml --no-session --params recipe_path="user_recipe.yaml" &gt; /logs/results.txt</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This runs our "base" recipe, and skips storing a session since this is a one-off GitHub action anyway. Our base recipe looks for a parameter of where to find the user's recipe file, so we pass that parameter into our headless mode, and then we log the results. Those results are later picked up by our GitHub action to populate a comment on a GitHub issue or pull request.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="building-community-trust">Building Community Trust<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#building-community-trust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Community Trust" title="Direct link to Building Community Trust" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The real win isn't just the automation of all of this, it's the transparency. Every analysis is visible, consistent, and explained. Community members can see exactly why a recipe passed or failed, which builds trust in both the system and the recipes themselves.</p>
<p>Goose catches edge cases that humans might miss, like subtle obfuscation techniques or patterns that only become obvious when you're analyzing dozens of recipes. It's like having a security expert with perfect attention to detail who never gets tired.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="using-ai-to-review-ai-to-review-submissions">Using AI to review AI to review submissions<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#using-ai-to-review-ai-to-review-submissions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using AI to review AI to review submissions" title="Direct link to Using AI to review AI to review submissions" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes the best way to solve a potential AI problem is with more AI. Goose understands Goose behavior patterns better than any human reviewer could. It knows the legitimate ways to automate tasks and can spot when something deviates from those patterns. Using Goose to build this scanner wasn't just a time-saver for making the tool, it's a productivity win for our team from manually review every recipe ourselves.</p>
<p>Anyone can submit a recipe knowing it'll get a fair, thorough review. And when you see a recipe get a security approval, remember: it was approved by Goose itself.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how MCP-UI is revolutionizing AI agent interactions by bringing rich, interactive web components directly into agent conversations, making AI more accessible and intuitive for everyone.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="mcp ui" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcpui-goose-44f248ede0eb5d2e0bddccf76e98b07e.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The days of endless text walls in AI agent conversations are numbered. What if instead of reading through paragraphs of product descriptions, you could browse a beautiful, interactive catalog? What if booking a flight seat could be as simple as clicking on your preferred spot on a visual seat map? This isn't science fiction. It's happening right now with MCP-UI.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GS-kmreZDgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Wild Goose Case episode</a>, we dove deep into MCP-UI with its creators Ido Salomon and Liad Yosef from Monday.com, alongside Block's own Andrew Harvard, to explore how this groundbreaking technology is reshaping the future of agentic interfaces.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-problem-with-text-only-interfaces">The Problem with Text-Only Interfaces<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-problem-with-text-only-interfaces" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem with Text-Only Interfaces" title="Direct link to The Problem with Text-Only Interfaces" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's be honest, we've all been there. You ask an AI agent to help you shop for shoes, and you get back a wall of text with product names, prices, and descriptions. Then you have to copy and paste URLs, open multiple tabs, and basically do all the work yourself. It defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant in the first place.</p>
<p>As Ido put it during our conversation: "I think everyone did something had a bunch of text and were like this is terrible why do I have to type all of that and kind of rage quit chat GPT."</p>
<p>The reality is that text-based interfaces work fine for early adopters and technical users, but they're not the future. They're certainly not going to work for everyone – including our moms, who are increasingly using AI assistants but shouldn't have to navigate complex text responses.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="enter-mcp-ui-bridging-the-gap">Enter MCP-UI: Bridging the Gap<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#enter-mcp-ui-bridging-the-gap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enter MCP-UI: Bridging the Gap" title="Direct link to Enter MCP-UI: Bridging the Gap" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP-UI (Model Context Protocol User Interface) represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI agent interactions. Instead of forcing users to consume everything through text, MCP-UI enables rich, interactive web components to be embedded directly into agent conversations.</p>
<p>The core philosophy is brilliant in its simplicity: <strong>Why throw away decades of web UI/UX expertise when we can enhance it with AI?</strong></p>
<p>As Liad explained: "We have more than a decade of human targeted interfaces on the web that are built and perfected for the human cognitive limitations and needs, and it doesn't make sense that agents will make us get rid of all of that."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-mcp-ui-works">How MCP-UI Works<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#how-mcp-ui-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How MCP-UI Works" title="Direct link to How MCP-UI Works" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>At its heart, MCP-UI is both a protocol and an SDK that enables:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Rich UI Components</strong>: Instead of text descriptions, you get interactive catalogs, seat maps, booking forms, and more</li>
<li class=""><strong>Brand Preservation</strong>: Companies like Shopify keep their branding and user experience intact</li>
<li class=""><strong>Seamless Integration</strong>: UI components communicate with agents through secure, sandboxed iframes</li>
<li class=""><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: The same UI can work across different AI agents and platforms</li>
</ol>
<p>The magic happens through embedded resources in the MCP specification. When you interact with an MCP server that supports UI, instead of just returning text, it can return rich UI components that render directly in your agent interface.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="real-world-examples-in-action">Real-World Examples in Action<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#real-world-examples-in-action" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real-World Examples in Action" title="Direct link to Real-World Examples in Action" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>During our demo, we saw some incredible examples of MCP-UI in action:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="shopping-made-visual">Shopping Made Visual<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#shopping-made-visual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shopping Made Visual" title="Direct link to Shopping Made Visual" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of reading through product descriptions, users saw a beautiful Shopify catalog with images, prices, and interactive elements. Clicking on items added them to a cart, just like a regular e-commerce experience, but embedded seamlessly in the AI conversation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="travel-planning-reimagined">Travel Planning Reimagined<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#travel-planning-reimagined" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Travel Planning Reimagined" title="Direct link to Travel Planning Reimagined" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>We watched as users could select airplane seats by clicking on a visual seat map, then have the agent automatically look up weather information for their destination cities, all without leaving the conversation or typing additional commands.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="restaurant-discovery">Restaurant Discovery<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#restaurant-discovery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Restaurant Discovery" title="Direct link to Restaurant Discovery" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The demo showed how users could browse local restaurants with rich cards showing photos, ratings, and menus, then place orders directly through interactive interfaces, all while maintaining the conversational flow with the AI agent.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-technical-foundation">The Technical Foundation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-technical-foundation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Technical Foundation" title="Direct link to The Technical Foundation" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>From a technical perspective, MCP-UI prioritizes security and isolation. UI components are rendered in sandboxed iframes that can only communicate with the host through post messages. This ensures that third-party UI code can't access or manipulate the parent application.</p>
<p>The current implementation supports several content types:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>External URLs</strong>: Existing web apps embedded in iframes</li>
<li class=""><strong>Raw HTML</strong>: Custom HTML components with CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li class=""><strong>Remote DOM</strong>: UI rendered in separate workers for enhanced security</li>
</ul>
<p>For developers, getting started is surprisingly simple. As Andrew demonstrated, you can begin with something as basic as:</p>
<div class="language-javascript codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-javascript codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword control-flow" style="color:#00009f">return</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">createUIResource</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">type</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'html'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">content</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;'</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-stakeholder-ecosystem">The Stakeholder Ecosystem<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-stakeholder-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Stakeholder Ecosystem" title="Direct link to The Stakeholder Ecosystem" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP-UI's success depends on several key stakeholders:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Agent Developers</strong> (like the Goose team): Need to implement MCP-UI support in their platforms</li>
<li class=""><strong>MCP Server Developers</strong>: Build the UI components and integrate them with existing services</li>
<li class=""><strong>Service Providers</strong> (like Shopify, Square): Create rich interfaces for their platforms</li>
<li class=""><strong>End Users</strong>: Benefit from more intuitive and visual AI interactions</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that it creates a network effect. Once implemented, a Shopify MCP-UI component works across all compatible agents – from Goose to VS Code extensions to future mobile AI assistants.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="looking-ahead-the-future-is-visual">Looking Ahead: The Future is Visual<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#looking-ahead-the-future-is-visual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Ahead: The Future is Visual" title="Direct link to Looking Ahead: The Future is Visual" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The implications of MCP-UI extend far beyond just prettier interfaces. We're looking at:</p>

<p>As Ido noted: "What's more accessible than an agent that knows you and builds the UI for your preferences? You don't need to rely on every web app in the world to support or build that."</p>

<p>The technology is ready, but adoption is the next frontier. As the team emphasized, this is now more of an adoption problem than a technical one. The good news? Major players are already on board. Shopify has launched MCP support for all their stores, providing a massive real-world testing ground for commerce experiences. And of course, MCP-UI is supported in Goose.</p>
<p>For developers interested in contributing, the focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Building real applications that solve actual user problems</li>
<li class="">Expanding the specification based on real-world needs</li>
<li class="">Creating better tooling and SDKs to lower the barrier to entry</li>

<p>MCP-UI represents a fundamental shift from text-heavy AI interactions to rich, visual, and intuitive experiences.</p>
<p>When you're browsing products, you want to see images and interact with catalogs. When you're booking travel, you want visual seat maps and itineraries. When you're managing your calendar, you want familiar interface patterns that just work.</p>
<p>MCP-UI makes all of this possible while preserving the conversational nature of AI agents. It's the bridge between the web as we know it and the agentic future we're building.</p>
<p>The future of interacting with AI relies on smarter interfaces. And with MCP-UI, that future is already here.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How a Junior developer's AI Agent confusion, led to creating an educational MCP extension that transforms Goose from an automation tool into a learning mentor.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Goose Mentor Mode Header" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-mentor-mode-header-77058a250a163440d791e057ef3196ea.png" width="2816" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Kim is fresh out of the academy and has spent only 18 months learning development. When I asked her how she felt about Goose she had mixed reactions. While she found it cool that it could do so much for her, she wasn’t actually sure of <em>what</em> it was doing for her half the time, and also <em>why</em>. When she asked Goose to fix a broken build, or chase a bug, It would complete the task and claim ‘Success!’. Which is great, however she felt she wasn’t actually learning as much as when she was in the academy. Add on that sometimes she didn’t even know <em>what</em> to ask Goose to do sometimes.</p>
<p>That afternoon I started to see if I could get Goose to be more than just a ‘magic box’ for my Junior Devs. What if Goose could instead act as a mentor and also teach as well as speeding up development?</p>
<p>Working as an Engineering Manager in the enterprise space, I have around 16 developers in my team. Like a lot of the industry right now I’ve been seeing where AI can fit within our processes, and what efficiencies it can provide. In July of this year I picked up Goose and quickly saw the incredible potential it had for both myself and my team. Excited to see what was possible, I quickly granted access to all my developers, hooked them up with a few different models, and then let them play for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Within my team I have a vast range of developer experience. From Tech Leads, all the way down to fresh graduates. The Seniors and Tech Leads were marvelling at the speed with which they could now progress their work. My mid level Devs were also amazed at how fast they could debug broken builds. It wasn’t until one of my regular catch up meetings with one of my Junior Graduates did I hear something different.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches"><strong>The Problem: AI That Does Instead of Teaches</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches" title="Direct link to the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditional AI coding assistants operate on a simple premise: user asks, AI delivers. While this maximizes immediate productivity, it creates several long-term problems:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Dependency Development</strong>: Developers become reliant on AI for problems they should understand</li>
<li class=""><strong>Lost Learning Opportunities</strong>: Every request could be a chance to build knowledge, but instead becomes just task completion</li>
<li class=""><strong>One-Size-Fits-All</strong>: No differentiation between a junior developer learning authentication and a senior developer implementing it under deadline pressure</li>
<li class=""><strong>Context Blindness</strong>: AI treats "how do I implement JWT?" the same whether it's asked by someone with 6 months or 6 years of experience</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-vision-goose-mentor-mode"><strong>The Vision: Goose Mentor Mode</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#the-vision-goose-mentor-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-vision-goose-mentor-mode" title="Direct link to the-vision-goose-mentor-mode" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The mission behind Goose Mentor Mode is simple but transformative: <strong>Transform AI assistance from automation to education while maintaining the efficiency developers need</strong>.</p>
<p>The core philosophy centers on four principles:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Discovery Over Delivery</strong>: Help users understand <em>why</em>, not just <em>how</em></li>
<li class=""><strong>Adaptive Learning</strong>: Adjust approach based on experience and context</li>
<li class=""><strong>Progressive Complexity</strong>: Build understanding layer by layer</li>
<li class=""><strong>Retention Focus</strong>: Emphasize learning that sticks</li>
</ol>

<p>The core of how I envision the system functioning is by configuring some basic assistance levels:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-four-adaptive-assistance-levels"><strong>🎯 Four Adaptive Assistance Levels</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#-four-adaptive-assistance-levels" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -four-adaptive-assistance-levels" title="Direct link to -four-adaptive-assistance-levels" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Think of the Assistance Modes as a dial that can balance the speed of learning against the speed of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>GUIDED Mode</strong> - For deep learning through discovery</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Uses Socratic questioning to guide users to solutions</li>
<li class="">Perfect for new concepts and skill building</li>
<li class=""><em>Example</em>: "What do you think JWT stands for? How might stateless authentication work?"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXPLAINED Mode</strong> - Education with implementation</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Provides detailed explanations alongside working code</li>
<li class="">Ideal for time-sensitive tasks with learning value</li>
<li class=""><em>Example</em>: "Here's how JWT works... [detailed explanation] + working code"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ASSISTED Mode</strong> - Quick help with learning context</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Direct assistance with educational insights</li>
<li class="">Best for experienced developers needing quick help</li>
<li class=""><em>Example</em>: "Use this JWT library. Key security considerations: [brief points]"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AUTOMATED Mode</strong> - Efficient task completion</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Direct solutions without educational overhead</li>
<li class="">For production pressure and repeated tasks</li>
<li class=""><em>Example</em>: "Here's the complete JWT implementation."</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now the system is in the PoC phase so I’m only using keyword checks for learning detection. I’m experimenting with semantic analysis to see if I can ‘intelligently’ do this, but that may prove overkill, or even bloat and slow down the system.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>19 Technical Concepts</strong> across 7 categories (security, database, API, architecture, testing, performance, DevOps)</li>
<li class=""><strong>6 Intent Categories</strong> for understanding request types (help requests, learning inquiries, debugging, etc.)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Context-Aware Analysis</strong> that distinguishes between "authentication error" vs "authentication best practices"</li>

<p>Although I did come up with the idea while at work, I quickly decided this would be a personal project outside of my organisation.

<p>Goose Mentor Mode represents more than just a new extension—it's a proof of concept for a fundamentally different relationship between developers and AI. Instead of creating dependency, it builds capability. Instead of providing fish, it teaches fishing.</p>
<p>The early results suggest this approach resonates with developers who want to grow, not just get things done. As AI becomes more prevalent in software development, tools like Goose Mentor Mode point toward a future where AI enhances human capability rather than replacing human thinking.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Why do AI agents forget? Learn how context windows, tokens, and Goose help you manage memory and long conversations.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Context Windows" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/contextwindow-fa46f7a54cfb23a538d62f0e4502e19e.png" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Working with AI tools can feel like working with a flaky, chaotic, but overconfident coworker. You know, the kind who forgets tasks, lies unprovoked, starts new projects without telling you, then quits halfway through. It's enough to make you say: "Forget it. I'll do it myself." But before we write off AI entirely, it's worth understanding what's actually happening under the hood so we can avoid common pitfalls and make AI tools worth using.</p>
<p>The root of this behavior stems from how AI tools handle working memory. Similarly, as a human, you can only juggle so much information at once. For example, when I'm reading a really long research paper, I might forget key details from the introduction by the time I reach the conclusion, even though those early points were important for understanding the whole argument.</p>
<p>The technical term for AI assistants' working memory is <strong>context window</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-is-a-context-window">What is a context window?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#what-is-a-context-window" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a context window?" title="Direct link to What is a context window?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A context window is the maximum amount of information an AI model can process in a single session. It's measured in "tokens."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-are-tokens">What are tokens?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#what-are-tokens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are tokens?" title="Direct link to What are tokens?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Tokens are how AI models break down text for processing. They're roughly equivalent to words or word fragments, though different models vary in how they tokenize text based on their training data and design choices.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong><br>
<!-- -->"Hello" = 1 token<br>
<!-- -->"Understanding" = 2 tokens ("Under" + "standing")<br>
<!-- -->"AI" = 1 token<br>
<!-- -->"Tokenization" = 3 tokens</p>
<p>Test it yourself: paste any text into <a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">OpenAI’s tokenizer tool</a> and explore how tokens are counted across models.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-goose-uses-tokens">How Goose uses tokens<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#how-goose-uses-tokens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Goose uses tokens" title="Direct link to How Goose uses tokens" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's talk about how this works in practice. When you use an AI agent like Goose, you start a session and choose a model like Claude Sonnet 3.7. This model has a context window of 128,000 tokens. This means every session (or conversation) can handle up to 128,000 tokens. If you message "hey" to Goose, you would have used one token. And when Goose responds back, you would have used several more tokens. Now you've used a small portion of your 128,000 tokens, and you have the remainder left.</p>

<p>Once the conversation goes past 128,000 tokens or gets close to it, your agent may start to forget key details from earlier in the conversation, and it might prioritize the most recent information.</p>
<p>But your conversation isn't the only thing using your tokens. Here are other things within Goose that consume your token budget:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>System prompt:</strong> A built-in prompt that instructs your agent on how to behave and defines its identity<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class="">The system prompt defines Goose’s name, creator (Block), current date/time, task and extension handling, and response format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class=""><strong>Extensions and their tool definitions</strong> - Many extensions have more than one tool built in. For example, a Google Drive extension may include tools like read file, create file, and comment on file. In addition, each tool comes with instructions on how to use it and an explanation of what the tool does.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Tool response</strong> - The response that the tool returns. For example, the tool could respond with "Here's the entire contents of your 500-line code file."</li>
<li class="">In addition to your conversation history, Goose keeps metadata about your conversation, such as timestamps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot of data, and it can easily consume your context window. In addition to impacting performance, token usage affects costs. The more tokens you use, the more money you pay, and you may feel frustrated wasting your tokens on your agent misinterpreting your request.</p>
<p>Luckily, Goose has an intelligent design for helping you save your context window.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-goose-automatically-manages-your-context-window">How Goose automatically manages your context window<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#how-goose-automatically-manages-your-context-window" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Goose automatically manages your context window" title="Direct link to How Goose automatically manages your context window" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Goose has a method that auto-compacts (or summarizes) your conversation once it reaches a certain threshold. By default, when you reach 80% of your context window, Goose summarizes the conversation, preserving key parts while compressing the rest, reducing context window usage so you can stay in your session without starting a new one.</p>
<p>You actually have the ability to customize the threshold. If you think 80% is too little or too much for your workflow, you can set the environment variable <code>GOOSE_AUTO_COMPACT_THRESHOLD</code> to your preferred threshold.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-to-manage-your-context-window">How to manage your context window<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#how-to-manage-your-context-window" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to manage your context window" title="Direct link to How to manage your context window" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>While Goose is adept at helping you manage your context window, you can proactively manage it, too. Here are some tips for efficiently managing your context window and your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>1. Manual summarization</strong></p>
<p>When your conversation gets too long, you can summarize the key points and start a new session. Copy important decisions, code snippets, or project requirements into the fresh session. This way, you keep the essential context without carrying over the full conversation history.</p>
<p><strong>2. <code>.goosehints</code></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/using-goosehints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">.goosehints</a> files to avoid repeating the same instructions. Instead of typing out your project context, coding standards, and preferences in every conversation, define them once in a .goosehints file. This prevents wasting tokens on repetitive explanations and helps Goose understand your requirements more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Memory extension</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/memory-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Memory extension</a> stores important information across sessions. Instead of re-explaining your project background, past decisions, or important context every time you start a new conversation, you can reference stored information. This keeps your prompts focused on the current task rather than repeating historical context.</p>
<p><strong>4. Recipes</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Recipes</a> package complete task setups into reusable configurations, eliminating the need to provide lengthy instructions repeatedly. Instead of consuming tokens explaining complex workflows in every session, recipes contain all necessary instructions, extensions, and parameters upfront. This is particularly valuable for repetitive tasks where you'd otherwise spend significant tokens on setup and explanation. And if your recipe starts to feel overly lengthy, you can break the tasks up into <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/subrecipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">subrecipes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Subagents</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/subagents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Subagents</a> handle specific tasks in their own isolated sessions. This prevents your main conversation from getting cluttered with implementation details and tool outputs. You delegate work to subagents and only see the final results, keeping your primary context window clean and focused.</p>
<p><strong>6. Short sessions</strong></p>
<p>Keep individual sessions focused on specific tasks. When you complete a task or reach a natural stopping point, start a new session. This prevents context window bloat from accumulated conversation history and ensures your tokens are spent on current, relevant work.</p>
<p><strong>7. Lead/worker model</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/lead-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Lead/Worker model</a> splits work between two models. The lead model handles high-level planning and decision-making, while the worker model executes the detailed implementation. This optimizes costs by using expensive models for strategic thinking and cheaper models for routine execution tasks.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next time your AI agent seems to 'forget' something important or goes off track, check your context window usage first. The solution might be a better prompt or a cleaner context window. Often, the difference between flaky and focused is just a few tokens.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A straightforward explanation of how agents are organized to work together]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/agent-coordination-52282acab8107e9503b17e471465ffa5.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I taught a <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents">vibe coding workshop at UC Berkeley</a> and informed the students that we'd be spinning up 7 subagents. Someone quickly raised their hand and asked "what is a subagent?". At that moment, I realized we're just throwing out terms like <strong>agent</strong>, <strong>multi agent</strong>, and <strong>subagent</strong>, and not really taking the time to explain what these are. So, here goes... a 101 breaking down these various coordination patterns and when to use them.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip admonition_xJq3 alert alert--success"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>TL;DR</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>agent</strong> – one autonomous actor that takes your goal and runs with it end to end</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>subagents</strong> - a setup where a main agent acts as orchestrator, delegating work to other agents it controls. The main agent owns the flow, order, and coordination.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>multi agents</strong> – two or more main agents, each acting independently but able to collaborate, negotiate, or exchange results. No single agent is "the boss".</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>These terms sound fancy, but at the end of the day, these are just different ways to get stuff done with AI. Kind of like deciding if you want to work solo, pair program, or lead a squad.</p>
<p><strong>Let me illustrate this with a simple new feature: adding dark mode to our company’s web app.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-agent-solo-hero-mode">The Agent: Solo Hero Mode<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#the-agent-solo-hero-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Agent: Solo Hero Mode" title="Direct link to The Agent: Solo Hero Mode" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>You give the task to one AI agent, such as <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/">Goose</a>. The agent is an autonomous actor, essentially your army of one.</p>
<p>You tell your agent, "Add dark mode to the app." It reads the repo, updates the CSS and themes, runs tests, and opens a PR. It handles the whole thing start to finish. No teammates, no handoffs.</p>
<p>If the agent messes up on one of these steps (e.g. say it forgets to update the toggle in the settings menu), it has to backtrack and fix it itself.</p>
<p>Think lone developer grinding through the ticket.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-subagent-setup-orchestrator-with-a-crew">The Subagent Setup: Orchestrator With a Crew<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#the-subagent-setup-orchestrator-with-a-crew" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Subagent Setup: Orchestrator With a Crew" title="Direct link to The Subagent Setup: Orchestrator With a Crew" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>With <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/subagents">subagents</a>, you still have one "main" agent, but instead of doing everything, it plays tech lead and delegates pieces of the work to other specialized agents.</p>
<p>The main agent says:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><em>"Designer agent, create the dark mode color palette."</em></li>
<li class=""><em>"Frontend agent, apply it to all UI components."</em></li>
<li class=""><em>"QA agent, run visual regression tests."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These subagents may work in parallel (e.g. while Designer is doing the palette, Frontend is updating styles) or sequentially (e.g. Frontend waits until Designer is done).</p>
<p>The main agent keeps everything on track, collects the results, and stitches them together.</p>
<p>Think of this as a tech lead breaking the feature into subtasks, assigning them, and merging the work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-multi-agent-scenario-two-main-brains-talking-it-out">The Multi Agent Scenario: Two Main Brains Talking It Out<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#the-multi-agent-scenario-two-main-brains-talking-it-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Multi Agent Scenario: Two Main Brains Talking It Out" title="Direct link to The Multi Agent Scenario: Two Main Brains Talking It Out" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>With multi agents, there's no single orchestrator. You've got multiple main agents that talk to each other, each with its own goals or perspective.</p>
<p>For our dark mode feature, imagine:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">The dev agent knows the codebase and can implement the UI changes.</li>
<li class="">The UX research agent knows how users interact with themes and what accessibility needs to be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>They work together. The UX agent explains the best practices, edge cases, and user pain points, while the dev agent implements and checks back for feedback. They might even run on different systems, like your dev agent calling an external design agent hosted somewhere else.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that multi agent setups don't have to be working on the exact same task. Sometimes they’re just operating in the same environment and will collaborate when their work overlaps.</p>
<p>Think of this as two peers hashing it out over Slack until they've got something solid.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="when-to-use-which">When to Use Which<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#when-to-use-which" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to Use Which" title="Direct link to When to Use Which" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>agent</strong>: small, self-contained tasks you trust one AI to own</li>
<li class=""><strong>subagents</strong>: complex tasks that benefit from dividing and conquering with oversight</li>
<li class=""><strong>multi agents</strong>: requires multiple brains or perspectives that can negotiate and collaborate</li>
</ul>
<p>These setups are just different ways to organize work, whether it's human work or AI work. The trick is picking the structure that gets you the best balance of speed and accuracy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How a simple prompt transformed a blank website into a personal portfolio]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/blog_banner-656bd5e1014edfbcd313a9f799f9e9a5.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A website to me is a corner of the internet where I can be who I am, share my work, and ultimately a place I can do whatever I want with. For it to be anything but my personality personified, especially as an ex-nerdy blog designer (in my middle school and high school days), felt so sad! Until suddenly, what started out as a harmless "404 Day" challenge quickly turned into making that website in basically no time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="going-back-to-my-roots">Going Back to My Roots<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#going-back-to-my-roots" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Going Back to My Roots" title="Direct link to Going Back to My Roots" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When I say I was a nerdy blog creator for other people, I mean I was living in the deep-end of HTML and CSS. It was a hobby where I got to create super-customized websites for other nerds like myself on the internet. So it was really bugging me to have a website today that was basically :poopemoji: personified. No character, no style of my own, just a minimal generic layout I was paying a monthly subscription for just to avoid complete embarassment. It's been a decade at least since then, and I was NOT in the mood to sit here and relearn pieces to create a website structure from scratch. I had all the pieces in my drafts, just needed structure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-404-challenge-that-started-it-all">The 404 Challenge That Started It All<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#the-404-challenge-that-started-it-all" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The 404 Challenge That Started It All" title="Direct link to The 404 Challenge That Started It All" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Then came this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/block-opensource_happy-404-day-we-used-goose-to-generate-activity-7313972103613939713-GF1T/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">simple and easy prompt on 404 day</a>. The post was about creating your own 404 page using goose, where goose will give you a custom page based on your profile. The original prompt went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a 404 page that tells a creative story about GitHub user @taniashiba using their public GitHub data — commit history, contribution graph, repos, or anything else you can access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took this prompt, and modified it a bit. My personal GitHub profile and contributions are great, but I also wanted to make sure goose referenced my LinkedIn, Instagram, and all other social channels to get a good grasp of me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also reference Tania's Bluesky/Instagram/TikTok/Twitter accounts (username @taniashiba) along with her LinkedIn for additional info on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="404 page" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/404page-a6e9f936e90c573008a5523d4779575e.png" width="1280" height="1196" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Quickly brought to life is a 404 page that is witty and actually pretty reflective of who I am and what I like in its styling. It even inserted a shrimp joke I had made in a past social post. I didn't even tell goose about any color combos I love, and somehow it made something that spoke to me. This lit a bright spark of inspiration. So, I asked goose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you remember that you made this? I'd love for you to make a website in this exact styling for taniachakraborty.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="implementation">Implementation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>goose was helping me resolve what felt like an age-old problem, and made it so simple to do. I gave goose my website, told goose it was hosted on Neocities, and it went to work. After creating general pages with the styling it made for the 404 page, implementation was easy:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Upload</strong> the files goose made onto Neocities</li>
<li class=""><strong>Review</strong> the site and ask goose to edit or create any pages I needed</li>
<li class=""><strong>Write content</strong> to fill the different pages of my website (my favorite part)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then boom, my website was done. No wrestling ancient memories from my mind to relearn CSS, no debugging issues caused by a responsive hover effect I thought was cool at 2 AM, no troubles at all. Goose handled everything. It started with a simple structure, used the styling it came up with from the 404 day challenge, and made changes as I asked for them in conversation. My website went from being embarrasingly empty to being wonderfully designed and easy to edit in <em>minutes</em>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="always-use-git">Always Use Git<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#always-use-git" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Always Use Git" title="Direct link to Always Use Git" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>It honestly felt like playing a video game, because I could see changes happen live in my local preview, and with git I could save progress as we went. Goose even suggested I add my blog posts from my dev.to page, and created a simple template for me. And if anything wasn't showing up as intended? We just troubleshooted together by me sending screenshots of what I was seeing, and goose simply fixing it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a-huge-timesaver-seriously">A HUGE Timesaver, Seriously<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#a-huge-timesaver-seriously" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A HUGE Timesaver, Seriously" title="Direct link to A HUGE Timesaver, Seriously" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Something that would've taken me anywhere from a week to a month to build was done instantly. Instead of worrying about learning or relearning a skill in order to build something you need right now, you can learn as you go along with goose. This entire experience reminded me why I fell in love with styling websites for others in the first place, you really create something out of nothing!</p>
<p>So if you're sitting there with a naked website that needs help, or if you've been putting off a project because the technical aspects feel like an overwhelming nightmare, maybe it's time you start a conversation with a useful tool like goose. And who knows? Maybe you will end up with your own digital aquarium of a website with shrimp jokes about debugging lurking in your website footer. 🦐</p>

<p><em>"The best AI agent workflows go beyond demos. They deliver real productivity."</em></p>
<p>The DevRel team at Block is a huge fan of <a href="https://pulsemcp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PulseMCP</a>. Their weekly newsletter has been an amazing way for us to discover trending MCP servers and stay in the loop with any changes within the ecosystem. When the PulseMCP creators, Mike and Tadas, shared their goals of using Goose to help <a href="https://www.pulsemcp.com/building-agents-with-goose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">automate the boring parts of their newsletter workflow</a>, we were excited to see what they'd build.</p>
<p>Their implementation showcased exactly why we built Goose's feature set the way we did, and they documented the entire journey to help others learn from their experience.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-challenge">The Challenge<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/13/pulse-mcp-automates-recipe#the-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Challenge" title="Direct link to The Challenge" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Every week, the PulseMCP team faced the same time-consuming workflow: sourcing relevant news from multiple platforms, organizing and removing duplicates, drafting compelling narratives, polishing for quality and accuracy, publishing across multiple channels, and managing email distribution. This repetitive workflow seemed perfect for AI automation, but was complex enough that most attempts fail.</p>

<p>Instead of building one massive "do-everything" agent (which inevitably fails on complex tasks), PulseMCP broke their workflow into six distinct phases. Each phase gets handled by focused <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/session-recipes">recipes</a>, <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/subrecipes">subrecipes</a> and <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/subagents">subagents</a> with clear inputs, outputs, and a single job.</p>
<p>This approach has three main benefits: debugging becomes easier when agents have single responsibilities, results become more predictable with clear handoffs between stages, and humans stay in control of the editorial process while automating the tedious work.</p>

<p>What's remarkable isn't just that PulseMCP automated their newsletter but how they kept human creativity while eliminating boring work. Humans still make editorial decisions, craft narratives, and maintain creative control, while agents handle repetitive tasks that drain human energy.</p>
<p>The result is a workflow that's both more efficient and higher quality. Agents never tire of checking links or formatting content, freeing humans to focus on strategic thinking and creative storytelling.</p>

<p>The PulseMCP team envisions agents that "build these recipes on your behalf." Imagine describing your workflow in natural language and having AI automatically generate the agent architecture and integration points.</p>
<p>We're already seeing hints of this capability. As Tadas demonstrated this by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hey Goose: I have these AI agent log files that are hard to read. Can you build me a simple web server with a pretty UI where I can parse through these as a human?"*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This points toward a future where AI handles the mechanics while humans focus on strategy, creativity, and judgment.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Automate MCP tool metadata validation using composable Goose recipes to catch regressions, optimize token usage, and ensure AI agents can reliably discover and use your tools.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Automated MCP Testing" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/automated_mcp_testing-296dac2cd2b1b327e58854f4bfb0c89a.jpg" width="1472" height="832" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, most development focuses on tool functionality, ensuring tools execute and return expected results. But just as critical is the quality of tool metadata: descriptions, tooltips, and input schemas. These elements form the "interface language" between tools and AI agents like Goose.</p>
<p>Yet metadata often goes untested. This can break tool discovery and silently degrade agent behavior. In this post, we’ll show how to automate metadata validation using <strong>composable Goose recipes</strong>, turning manual QA into modular, repeatable workflows that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Validate tool discoverability and parameter accuracy</li>
<li class="">Detect regressions early</li>
<li class="">Safely reduce token usage</li>
</ul>
<p>All while maintaining the quality that AI agents depend on.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="1-the-challenges-of-manual-metadata-testing">1. The Challenges of Manual Metadata Testing<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#1-the-challenges-of-manual-metadata-testing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. The Challenges of Manual Metadata Testing" title="Direct link to 1. The Challenges of Manual Metadata Testing" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Manually validating MCP metadata—by running queries and inspecting agent behavior—breaks down quickly as your toolset grows. It’s inefficient, inconsistent, and prone to silent regressions.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="key-limitations">Key Limitations:<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#key-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Limitations:" title="Direct link to Key Limitations:" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Slow &amp; Unscalable</strong>: Requires spinning up the agent, entering queries, and reviewing outputs by hand.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Inconsistent Results</strong>: Varies across environments and models, making issues hard to reproduce.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Silent Failures</strong>: Broken tooltips lead to incorrect tool selection, missing or misinterpreted parameters, and tool conflicts.</li>
<li class=""><strong>No Regression Safety Net</strong>: Changes in one tool’s metadata can affect others with no system in place to detect it.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Poor Coverage</strong>: Manual QA can’t account for the diversity of real-world user queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep pace with growing MCP complexity, <strong>automated metadata validation becomes a practical necessity</strong>.</p>

<p>The foundation of this framework is <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Goose’s recipe engine</a>. Recipes define reusable, declarative workflows for AI-assisted tasks. Each one encapsulates a step—like generating predictions or comparing results—and can be composed into larger pipelines.</p>
<p>We start with a core recipe that maps natural language queries to tool calls. It reads queries, analyzes the toolset, and produces structured JSON mappings. This recipe becomes the building block for workflows like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Evaluating predictions against a gold set</li>
<li class="">Integrating regression checks into CI</li>
<li class="">Running token optimization loops</li>
</ul>
<p>By chaining and wrapping recipes, we avoid duplication and unlock scalable, repeatable QA for MCP tool discoverability.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="3-the-core-engine-goose-recipe-for-tool-prediction">3. The Core Engine: Goose Recipe for Tool Prediction<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#3-the-core-engine-goose-recipe-for-tool-prediction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. The Core Engine: Goose Recipe for Tool Prediction" title="Direct link to 3. The Core Engine: Goose Recipe for Tool Prediction" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>At the heart of the system is a Goose recipe that systematically transforms natural language queries into structured tool predictions. This recipe follows a clear three-step process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>read queries → analyze tools → generate predictions</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-how-it-works-step-by-step">🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#-how-it-works-step-by-step" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step" title="Direct link to 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: Read Queries</strong>
The recipe starts by reading a plain text file containing natural language queries, one per line:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">List contributors to the block/mcp repository</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">List the top 10 contributors to block/goose</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Show me the closed branches in block/mcp</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Show me all branches in the block/goose repository</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Ask Goose to Make Predictions</strong>
Using the developer extension, Goose analyzes the MCP server source code and documentation to understand available tools, their parameters, and usage patterns. It then maps each query to the most appropriate tool call.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Write Predictions to JSON</strong>
The output is a structured JSON file with each query mapped to its expected tool and parameters.</p>

<p>Having established the core Goose recipe component in Section 3, we can now leverage its modularity to build more complex workflows. The beauty of this architecture is that the core prediction recipe becomes a reusable building block—we can reference it from other recipes, chain it with comparison logic, and compose end-to-end testing pipelines. This demonstrates the power of treating recipes as separate modules that can be orchestrated together for sophisticated automation workflows.</p>
<p>Once predictions are generated via the core recipe, the next step is to detect regressions by comparing them against a curated "gold standard" dataset. This automated evaluation follows a clear three-step process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>generate predictions → compare with gold set → interpret results</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-how-it-works-step-by-step-1">🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#-how-it-works-step-by-step-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step" title="Direct link to 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: Generate Predictions Using the Core Recipe</strong>
First, we run the core recipe from Section 3 to generate fresh predictions based on the current tool metadata:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">goose run --recipe generate_predictions_recipe.yaml --params output_file=new_evaluation.json</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This produces a JSON file with current tool predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Compare Predictions with Gold Standard</strong>
Next, we use a Python comparison script to identify differences between the new predictions and our verified gold standard:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">python compare_results.py new_evaluation.json mcp_github_query_tool_truth.json</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The script performs a structured diff, flagging mismatches in tool names, parameters, or values.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Ask Goose to Interpret Results</strong>
Finally, Goose analyzes the comparison output and highlights what's not matching, providing human-readable explanations of the differences.</p>

<p>Building on the modular recipe architecture established in previous sections, we can create even more sophisticated workflows that combine multiple automation steps. One powerful example is an iterative token reduction pipeline that safely compresses MCP tool descriptions while ensuring functionality remains intact.</p>
<p>This workflow demonstrates the true power of composable Goose recipes—we can orchestrate the core prediction recipe from Section 3 and the evaluation workflow from Section 4 into a continuous optimization loop that reduces token usage without breaking tool discoverability.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-the-optimization-loop-step-by-step">🔄 The Optimization Loop: Step-by-Step<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#-the-optimization-loop-step-by-step" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔄 The Optimization Loop: Step-by-Step" title="Direct link to 🔄 The Optimization Loop: Step-by-Step" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>The token reduction workflow follows an iterative process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>reduce tokens → run evaluation → fix issues → run evaluation → repeat</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compress Tool Descriptions</strong>
Using natural language processing, Goose identifies verbose tooltips, redundant documentation, and unnecessary examples, then compresses them while preserving essential information.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Run Evaluation Pipeline</strong>
The system automatically triggers the evaluation workflow from Section 4 to test whether the compressed descriptions still allow correct tool discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Fix Issues</strong>
If evaluation tests fail, Goose analyzes the specific mismatches and iteratively fixes the compressed tooltips to restore functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Repeat Until Success</strong>
The loop continues until all evaluation tests pass, ensuring no regressions in tool discoverability.</p>

<p>Automated MCP metadata validation doesn’t have to be brittle or one-off. By using a <strong>modular Goose recipe architecture</strong>, we’ve shown how a single core prediction recipe can power multiple high-value workflows—from <strong>catching regressions early</strong> to <strong>reducing tokens safely</strong> without sacrificing discoverability.</p>
<p>This composable approach offers three big wins:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Reusability</strong> – The same core logic supports different workflows without rewriting code.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Safety</strong> – Automated validation ensures changes never silently break tool usage.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Scalability</strong> – The architecture works across any MCP server or toolset, regardless of size.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these building blocks in place, teams can confidently expand their automation toolkit—knowing every new optimization or enhancement will be backed by the same rigorous, repeatable validation process.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Dive into Goose's Lead/Worker model where one LLM plans while another executes - a game-changing approach to AI collaboration that can save costs and boost efficiency.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog cover" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/header-image-bed3ed59a52ea231c1da0707b9b6d287.png" width="1200" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Ever wondered what happens when you let two AI models work together like a tag team? That’s exactly what we tested in our latest livestream—putting Goose’s Lead/Worker model to work on a real project. Spoiler: it’s actually pretty great.</p>
<p>The Lead/Worker model is one of those features that sounds simple on paper but delivers some amazing benefits in practice. Think of it like having a project manager and a developer working in perfect harmony - one does the strategic thinking, the other gets their hands dirty with the actual implementation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="whats-this-leadworker-thing-all-about">What's This Lead/Worker Thing All About?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/llm-tag-team-lead-worker-model#whats-this-leadworker-thing-all-about" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's This Lead/Worker Thing All About?" title="Direct link to What's This Lead/Worker Thing All About?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Instead of asking one LLM to do everything, Lead/Worker lets you split the load. Your lead model takes care of the thinking, decision-making, and big-picture planning, while your worker model focuses on execution—writing code, running commands, and making the plan happen. The magic is in the balance: you can put a more powerful (and sometimes more expensive) model in the lead and let a faster, more cost-effective one handle the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Popular model pairings people are loving:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">GPT-4 + Claude Sonnet – Balanced intelligence and efficiency.</li>
<li class="">Claude Opus + GPT-3.5 – Creative planning with quick execution.</li>
<li class="">GPT-4o + Local models – Privacy-focused builds where data stays in-house.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-youll-love-this-setup">Why You'll Love This Setup<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/llm-tag-team-lead-worker-model#why-youll-love-this-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why You'll Love This Setup" title="Direct link to Why You'll Love This Setup" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p>💰 Cost Optimization
Use cheaper models for execution while keeping the premium models for strategic planning. Your wallet will thank you.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>⚡ Speed Boost<br>
<!-- -->Get solid plans from capable models, then let optimized execution models fly through the implementation.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>🔄 Mix and Match Providers
This is where it gets really cool - you can use Claude for reasoning and OpenAI for execution, or any combination that works for your workflow.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>🏃‍♂️ Handle Long Dev Sessions
Perfect for those marathon coding sessions where you need sustained performance without breaking the bank.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting started with the Lead/Worker model is surprisingly straightforward. In the Goose desktop app, you just need to:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Enable the feature</strong> - Look for the enable button in your settings</li>
<li class=""><strong>Choose your lead model</strong> - Pick something powerful for planning (like GPT-4)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Select your worker model</strong> - Go with something efficient for execution (like Claude Sonnet)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Configure the behavior</strong> - Set how many turns the worker gets before consulting the lead</li>
</ol>
<p>The default settings work great for most people, but you can customize things like:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Number of turns</strong>: How many attempts the worker model gets before pulling in the lead</li>
<li class=""><strong>Failure handling</strong>: What happens when things don't go as planned</li>
<li class=""><strong>Fallback behavior</strong>: How the system recovers from issues</li>
</ul>

<p>During our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbBDBv9Chvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">livestream</a>, we tackled a real project: adding install buttons to the MCP servers documentation page. What made this interesting wasn't just the end result, but watching how the two models collaborated.</p>
<p>The lead model would analyze the requirements, understand the existing codebase structure, and create a plan. Then the worker model would jump in and start implementing, making the actual code changes and handling the technical details.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-project-documentation-enhancement">The Project: Documentation Enhancement<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/llm-tag-team-lead-worker-model#the-project-documentation-enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Project: Documentation Enhancement" title="Direct link to The Project: Documentation Enhancement" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>We wanted to add install buttons to our MCP server cards, similar to what we already had on our extensions page. We needed to figure out how to add this functionality without breaking existing workflows.</p>
<p>Here's what the Lead/Worker model helped us accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Analyzed the existing documentation structure</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>Identified the best approach</strong> (creating a custom page vs. modifying existing ones)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Implemented the solution</strong> with proper routing and styling</li>
<li class=""><strong>Handled edge cases</strong> like maintaining tutorial links while adding install functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that really stood out was how natural the interaction felt. You're not constantly switching contexts or managing different tools. You just describe what you want, and the system figures out the best way to divide the work.</p>
<p>The lead model acts as your strategic partner, while the worker model becomes your implementation buddy. It's like pair programming, but with AI models that never get tired or need coffee breaks.</p>

<p>We always recommend setting up your <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/using-goosehints">goosehints</a> to give context about your project. It saves you from re-explaining the same things over and over.</p>

<p>Let the lead model do its planning thing. Sometimes the best results come from giving high-level direction and letting the system figure out the details.</p>

<p>Always work in a branch when experimenting. The models are smart, but having that safety net means you can be more adventurous with your requests.</p>

<p>While the desktop UI doesn't show the model switching as clearly as the CLI does, you can still follow along by expanding the tool outputs to see what's happening under the hood.</p>

<p>By the end of our session, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">✅ Successfully added install buttons to our MCP server documentation</li>
<li class="">✅ Maintained all existing functionality (tutorial links still worked)</li>
<li class="">✅ Improved the user experience with better visual hierarchy</li>
<li class="">✅ Organized content into logical sections (community vs. built-in servers)</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part? The models made smart decisions we hadn't even thought of, like automatically categorizing the servers and improving the overall page layout.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="ready-to-try-it-yourself">Ready to Try It Yourself?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/llm-tag-team-lead-worker-model#ready-to-try-it-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ready to Try It Yourself?" title="Direct link to Ready to Try It Yourself?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="" href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/lead-worker">Lead/Worker model</a> is available now in Goose. Whether you're working on documentation, building features, or tackling complex refactoring, having two specialized models working together can be a game changer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A first look at a UI for agents built on the proposed MCP-UI extension]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog cover" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcp-ui-shot-1b80ebfab25d885a8ead1ca24bb6cf13.png" width="2360" height="1142" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Goose recently released support for <a href="https://mcpui.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MCP-UI</a> which allows MCP servers to suggest and contribute user interface elements back to the agent.</p>

It works as is but may change as the proposal advances.</p></div></div>
<p>MCP-UI sits on top of the protocol, but instead of text/markdown being the result, servers can return content that the client can render richly (including interactive GUI content).</p>
<p>Many everyday activities that agents undertake could benefit from a graphical representation. Sometimes this is done by the agent rendering a GUI on its own (I know I do that a lot), but this allows it to be more intrinsic to extensions for cases where interaction is best done graphically with a human. It also naturally (hence the <a href="https://shopify.engineering/mcp-ui-breaking-the-text-wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Shopify connection</a>) works well with commerce applications where you want to see the product!</p>
<p>It is worth taking a minute to watch this MCP server for an airline seat selector demo to get a sense of the capability:</p>
<video controls="" class="aspect-ratio" poster="/goose/assets/images/mcp-ui-shot-1b80ebfab25d885a8ead1ca24bb6cf13.png" playsinline=""><source src="/goose/assets/medias/mcp-ui-4ec39098756f9fa98c1ac3c08bd5807b.mov" type="video/mp4"><p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p></video>
<p>Essentially, MCP servers are suggesting GUI elements for the client (agent) to render as it sees fit.</p>

<p>The <code>mimeType</code> is where the action happens. It can be HTML content, for example (in the simplest case).</p>
<p>Another key tech at play here is <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/remote-dom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Remote DOM</a>, which is an open source project from Shopify. It lets you take DOM elements from a sandboxed environment and render them in another one, which is quite useful for agents. This also opens up the possibility that the agent side can render widgets as it needs (i.e., with locally matching styles or design language).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="possible-futures">Possible futures<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/mcp-ui-post-browser-world#possible-futures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Possible futures" title="Direct link to Possible futures" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>It's still early days for MCP-UI, so the details may change, but that is part of what makes experimenting with it exciting right now.</p>
<p>MCP-UI will continue to evolve, and may pick up more declarative ways for MCP-UI servers to specify they need forms or widgets of certain types, but without specifying the exact rendering. How nice would it be to be able to specify these components and let the agent render it beautifully, be that in a desktop or mobile client, or even a text UI in a command line!</p>
